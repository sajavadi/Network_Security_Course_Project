The program includes two main functions:
    (1) clientProxy: this function is run as a pbproxy_c. It creates one thread that is responsible to
        receives packets from pbproxy_s and decrypt them and write in the stdout! The function itself,
        in a while(1) loop, reads data from stdin and sends it to the pbproxy_s! The thread runs the following
        function: receiveFromServerWrite2Stdout!
    (2) serverProxy: this function is run as pbproxy_s. It creates a new thread for every incoming connection. 
        The function run for each new thread is connectionHandler. This function creates another thread that
        runs the function receiveFromClientSend2Server. This function is responsible for receiving packets
        from pbproxy_c and sending it to sshd! connectionHandler also in a while(1) loops relay the responses
        of sshd to pbproxy_c!
We use two Initial Vectors in our encryption processes (per connection)! One is created and sent by clientProxy
and is received by receiveFromClientSend2Server. This IV is used to encrypt the traffic from pbproxy_c to 
pbproxy_s! Another IV is created and sent by connectionHandler and received by receiveFromServerWrite2Stdout.
This IV is used in the encryption of traffic from pbproxy_s to pbproxy_s!

We tried to cover all possible errors and do the needed actions (Here we simply return)!
We also write error message in the client side to a file!
The log file is created in /tmp and the file name is pbproxy.log! 

We also wrote a very simple program that get  a file name as input and creates a random 128 bit
data and write in the file! We can use this file as key file!! 

More detailed comments are provided in the program through comments! 


Here is the sample execution of the program! As you can see, the threads that are created for each
new connection are closed appropriately! Notice that we need to copy the program executable into bin
directory.

Finally, result of experiment for connecting from the VM to the local machine using the pbproxy:

Server:

sh-3.2# cp pbproxy /usr/bin/
sh-3.2# ./pbproxy -k /keys/keyfile -l 3333 localhost 22
new connection 
Server: The client connection is closed
Server: Error in receiving data from ssh server
